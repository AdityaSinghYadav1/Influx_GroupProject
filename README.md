# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze vehicle pollution data to derive insights related to fuel consumption and CO2 emissions across various vehicle classes, fuel types, and engine specifications. By utilizing this dataset meaningful insights can be drawn that can help in informed decision-making for various stakeholders regarding environmental impact and fuel efficiency.
# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains comprehensive information including:-
1. Make: The manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Audi, BMW).
2. Model: The specific model of the vehicle (e.g., A4, 320i).
3. Vehicle Class: The category of the vehicle (e.g., Compact, SUV).
4. Engine Size: The size of the engine in liters (e.g., 2.0 L).
5. Cylinders: The number of cylinders in the engine (e.g., 4 or 6).
6. Transmission: The type of transmission (e.g., Automatic, Manual).
7. Fuel Type: The type of fuel used by the vehicle (e.g., Gasoline, Diesel).
8. Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km): The amount of fuel consumed in city driving conditions measured in liters per 100 kilometers.
9. Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km): The amount of fuel consumed on highways measured in liters per 100 kilometers.
10. Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km): The combined fuel consumption measured in liters per 100 kilometers.
11. Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg): The combined fuel consumption converted to miles per gallon.
12. CO2 Emissions (g/km): The amount of CO2 emissions produced per kilometer traveled measured in grams
# Objectives
1. Analyze CO2 Emissions: Calculate the average CO2 emissions for different vehicle classes and fuel types over the last hour to understand which categories contribute most to pollution.
2. Evaluate Fuel Consumption: Assess the average fuel consumption in city driving conditions based on transmission types over the last hour to identify more efficient vehicle options.
3. Identify Maximum Highway Fuel Consumption: Determine the maximum highway fuel consumption for various engine sizes over the past 24 hours, which can help highlight high-performance vehicles.
4. Examine Combined Fuel Consumption: Calculate the combined fuel consumption for vehicles based on their cylinder counts over the last 12 hours to evaluate efficiency across different engine configurations.
5. Assess Fuel Efficiency in MPG: Analyze the average combined fuel consumption in miles per gallon (MPG) based on make over the last 30 minutes to provide insights into consumer choices regarding fuel-efficient vehicles.
